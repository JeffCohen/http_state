== HTTP STATE

This app demonstrates that HTTP is "stateless."  This means that your app won't "remember" anything from one request to the next.  Each request must contain enough information for the app to perform its work, without any knowledge of what came before.

Read this code and try to find out how the app *appears* to remember who's logged in, even though we know that HTTP itself is a stateless protocol.
